# GTRC-Net

Pre-trained model based on JNM Manuscript (https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.125.270077) with the omission of cases included in DEEP-PSMA testing dataset can be found in [GTRC-Net-Pretrained](https://github.com/Peter-MacCallum-Cancer-Centre/GTRC-Net-Pretrained).

Pre-trained model based on [DEEP-PSMA Grand Challenge](https://deep-psma.grand-challenge.org/) dataset now available for PSMA and FDG PET/CT segmentation (100 cases per tracer): https://github.com/Peter-MacCallum-Cancer-Centre/GTRC-Net-DEEP-PSMA.

Other contents of this repository are for training new models based on ground truth segmentation data. Use the links above if intending to perform segmentation from existing model data.
